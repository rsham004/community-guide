# ♻️ Advanced: MCP Server Lifecycle Management

As your MCP servers become more complex, especially when interacting with external resources like databases, message queues, or other stateful services, properly managing the server's lifecycle becomes crucial. This involves performing setup actions when the server starts and cleanup actions when it stops.

## 🤔 Why Is Lifecycle Management Important?

- **Resource Management:** Ensures that connections (e.g., database pools, network sockets) are established correctly on startup and gracefully closed on shutdown, preventing resource leaks or dangling connections.
- **Initialization:** Allows for loading configurations, initializing caches, or performing other setup tasks required before the server can handle requests.
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Ensures that ongoing tasks can complete (if possible) and resources are released cleanly before the server process exits, preventing data corruption or inconsistent states.

## ✨ The `lifespan` Concept

Many modern Python web frameworks and SDKs, including those potentially used for building MCP servers (like Starlette, FastAPI, and possibly aspects of `mcp-cli` when integrated with ASGI), provide a mechanism often referred to as `lifespan` management.

The `lifespan` protocol typically uses an **async context manager** or a pair of startup/shutdown event handlers to manage resources tied to the application's lifetime.

### Conceptual Example using Async Context Manager:

```python
import asyncio
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
# Assume 'mcp_app' is your MCP application instance (e.g., from FastMCP or similar)
# Assume 'DatabaseConnectionPool' is a hypothetical class for managing DB connections

@asynccontextmanager
async def app_lifespan(app):
    # Code here runs ON STARTUP
    print("Server starting up...")
    # Example: Initialize a database connection pool
    db_pool = DatabaseConnectionPool()
    await db_pool.connect()
    app.state.db_pool = db_pool # Store the pool on the app state for access in tools
    print("Database pool connected.")

    try:
        yield # Server runs while in the 'yield' block
        # The application is now ready to handle requests/tool calls
    finally:
        # Code here runs ON SHUTDOWN
        print("Server shutting down...")
        # Example: Close the database connection pool
        if hasattr(app.state, 'db_pool'):
            await app.state.db_pool.disconnect()
            print("Database pool disconnected.")
        print("Shutdown complete.")

# Integrate the lifespan manager with your MCP application
# The exact method depends on the framework/SDK being used.
# Example for frameworks like Starlette/FastAPI:
# mcp_app = FastMCP(lifespan=app_lifespan)
# Or potentially configured during server run:
# uvicorn server:mcp_app --lifespan on
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`@asynccontextmanager`**: Decorator to create an async context manager.
2.  **Code Before `yield`**: Executes when the server starts up. Ideal for initializing resources like database connections, loading models, etc. Resources can often be stored on the application's `state` object for access elsewhere.
3.  **`yield`**: The server runs and handles requests/tool calls during this phase.
4.  **Code After `yield` (in `finally` block)**: Executes when the server receives a shutdown signal (e.g., Ctrl+C, termination signal). Ideal for cleaning up resources (closing connections, saving state). The `finally` block ensures cleanup happens even if errors occur during runtime.

## ✅ When to Use Lifecycle Management

- **Connecting to Databases:** Essential for managing connection pools.
- **External Service Connections:** Setting up and tearing down connections to APIs, message queues (like RabbitMQ, Kafka), or caches (like Redis).
- **Loading Large Resources:** Initializing machine learning models or large datasets into memory on startup.
- **Background Tasks:** Starting and stopping background worker tasks associated with the server.

While not always necessary for the simplest MCP servers (especially STDIO-based ones with minimal external interaction), implementing proper lifecycle management using `lifespan` or similar mechanisms is a best practice for building robust, production-ready MCP servers that interact with external systems.

## 📝 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Preparation
- [ ] Identify the need for lifecycle management in your MCP server (e.g., database connections, external service clients, model loading) (Easy)
- [ ] Ensure your MCP server is built using a framework/approach that supports lifespan management (e.g., Starlette, FastAPI, or an SDK integrating with ASGI) (Medium)
- [ ] Import `asynccontextmanager` from `contextlib` (Easy)

### Phase 2: Lifespan Function Implementation
- [ ] Define an asynchronous function for the lifespan manager (e.g., `async def app_lifespan(app):`) (Easy)
- [ ] Decorate the function with `@asynccontextmanager` (Easy)
- [ ] **Startup Logic (Before `yield`):**
    - [ ] Add code to initialize necessary resources (e.g., create DB connection pool, load config, initialize ML models) (Medium/Complex depending on resource)
    - [ ] Use `await` for any asynchronous setup operations (e.g., `await db_pool.connect()`) (Medium)
    - [ ] Store shared resources on the application state object if needed (e.g., `app.state.db_pool = db_pool`) so tools/endpoints can access them (Medium)
    - [ ] Add logging/print statements for startup confirmation (Easy)
- [ ] Include the `yield` statement to pause execution while the server runs (Easy)
- [ ] **Shutdown Logic (Inside `finally` block after `yield`):**
    - [ ] Add a `try...finally` block around the `yield` statement (Easy)
    - [ ] Add code within the `finally` block to clean up resources initialized during startup (e.g., `await app.state.db_pool.disconnect()`) (Medium)
    - [ ] Ensure cleanup code handles cases where resources might not have been initialized successfully (e.g., check `hasattr(app.state, 'db_pool')`) (Medium)
    - [ ] Add logging/print statements for shutdown confirmation (Easy)

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Integrate the `app_lifespan` function with your MCP/ASGI application instance (e.g., `app = FastMCP(lifespan=app_lifespan)`) (Easy/Medium depending on framework)
- [ ] If running via an ASGI server like `uvicorn`, ensure lifespan support is enabled if necessary (e.g., `uvicorn server:app --lifespan on`) (Easy)
- [ ] Start the server and verify startup logs/resource initialization (Easy)
- [ ] Test server functionality (e.g., tool calls that use the initialized resources) (Medium)
- [ ] Stop the server gracefully (e.g., Ctrl+C) and verify shutdown logs/resource cleanup (Easy)
