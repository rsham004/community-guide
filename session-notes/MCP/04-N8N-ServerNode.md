# N8N Native MCP Server Node 

With the release of [n8n](../../tools/infrastructure/n8n.md) version 1.88, a native integration for **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers is now available. This integration introduces two new nodes:

- `MCP Server Trigger`
- `MCP Client Tool`

This document breaks down what these nodes do, their current capabilities and limitations, and how they fit into broader MCP workflows, particularly when using a self-hosted n8n instance as described in [03-N8N-selfhost+mcp.md](./03-N8N-selfhost+mcp.md).

---

## 🔧 What Are the New Nodes?

### MCP Server Trigger
- Functions similarly to a webhook.
- Provides **Test URL** and **Production URL**, just like native webhook triggers.
- Used to receive data from MCP clients (e.g. Claude Desktop or Cursor IDE).

### MCP Client Tool
- Connects to an external `MCP Server Trigger` via **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**.
- Sends tool invocation requests from agents to N8N workflows.

---

## 🧪 Benefits of the Native Integration

- **Simplifies Connection**: Previously required custom nodes and self-hosting.
- **Direct IDE Integration**: Allows Claude Desktop, Cursor, and others to trigger N8N tools directly.
- **Structured Tool Invocations**: Enables specific tools to be called with expected parameters.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations and Considerations

### 1. No Full MCP Agent Yet
While this integration brings client/server interactions into N8N, it doesn’t yet support:
- True multi-tool routing.
- Dynamic tool selection based on agent reasoning.
- Full agent orchestration like a Jarvis-style assistant.

### 2. Limited Protocol Support
- Native nodes support only **SSE** (Server-Sent Events).
- Many existing community MCP servers use **STDIO**, which is not supported natively.

### 3. Lack of Dynamic Tool Invocation
- Tools in N8N require fixed **operation** and **resource** parameters.
- Ideal future: A single Gmail MCP server that dynamically routes based on model input.

### 4. Prompting Challenges
- No control over how prompts are sent into workflows.
- Agent might send a full response instead of structured input (e.g. generating a full LinkedIn post before triggering research).

## 🔌 Connecting Claude Desktop to N8N

### Setup (Example: Claude Desktop):
1. Enable **Developer Mode** in the Claude Desktop application.
2. Locate and edit the client's configuration file (often `config.json` - consult your specific client's documentation for the exact location and format) to add the **Production URL** from the n8n `MCP Server Trigger` node.
3. Restart the client application (e.g., Claude Desktop) to fetch the tools exposed by the n8n workflow.

The client should now display the tools available from your [n8n](../../tools/infrastructure/n8n.md) MCP server and allow direct invocation. Similar steps apply to other MCP clients like Cursor (for [VS Code](../../tools/foundational/VSCode.md)), but the specific configuration details may vary.

## 📦 Real-World Examples

### Use Case 1: Create Calendar Event
- Ask Claude: “Create an event for 3PM.”
- Claude uses the [n8n](../../tools/infrastructure/n8n.md) MCP tool to trigger a `createEvent` workflow.
- Workflow parses title/time and adds event to calendar.

### Use Case 2: LinkedIn + Slack Integration
- Ask Claude: “Create a LinkedIn post about Nvidia and share it in Slack.”
- Claude:
  - Triggers LinkedIn post generator via MCP.
  - Triggers Slack message tool with the post content.
- Result: Post appears in sheet + message sent in Slack.

## 💡 Final Thoughts

This native MCP integration in [n8n](../../tools/infrastructure/n8n.md) is:
- A **great step forward** for tool integration and automation.
- Not yet a **full agent-based framework**, but a very usable starting point.
- A **must-have** if you're working with Claude, Cursor, or building multi-tool automations.

As standards around MCP mature, expect much deeper automation and flexibility in future updates.
