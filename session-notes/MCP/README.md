# Session Notes: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

These notes cover the concepts, technologies, and implementation patterns related to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP provides a standardized way for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Agents to interact with external tools and services.

## Reading Order & File Overview

These notes cover various aspects of MCP, from concepts to implementation. You can read them sequentially or jump to specific topics:

**Core Concepts:**
1.  **[01-MCP-overview.md](./01-MCP-overview.md):** Introduces the core concepts of MCP, the problems it solves, its components, history, and potential. Start here for a foundational understanding.
2.  **[02-Transport-Mechanisms.md](./02-Transport-Mechanisms.md):** Explains Server-Sent Events (SSE) and compares it with STDIO, key transport mechanisms for MCP.

**Python SDK Implementation:**
3.  **[05-Python-SDK-Implementation.md](./05-Python-SDK-Implementation.md):** Covers building basic MCP servers and clients using the official Python SDK (`mcp-cli`), including STDIO/SSE transport, the MCP Inspector, and comparison to standard function calling.
4.  **[06-Integrating-MCP-with-LLMs.md](./06-Integrating-MCP-with-LLMs.md):** Details the practical steps and patterns for integrating MCP tools fetched via the SDK into LLM applications, focusing on the OpenAI API workflow.

**Deployment & Advanced Topics:**
5.  **[07-Docker-and-Deployment-Concepts.md](./07-Docker-and-Deployment-Concepts.md):** Discusses using Docker to containerize Python MCP servers, provides an example Dockerfile, and outlines general deployment concepts and platforms.
6.  **[08-Advanced-Lifecycle-Management.md](./08-Advanced-Lifecycle-Management.md):** Introduces the `lifespan` concept for managing resources (like database connections) during server startup and shutdown in more complex applications.

**Specific Implementation Examples:**
7.  **n8n Implementation:**
    *   **[03-N8N-selfhost+mcp.md](./03-N8N-selfhost+mcp.md):** Practical guide to setting up self-hosted n8n.
    *   **[04-N8N-ServerNode.md](./04-N8N-ServerNode.md):** Details using n8n's native MCP nodes to act as an MCP server.
8.  **FastMCP/GCP Implementation:**
    *   **[09-FastMCP-GCP-Example.md](./09-FastMCP-GCP-Example.md):** Step-by-step guide to building a custom server with Python, FastMCP, SSE, and deploying to Google Cloud Run.
    *   **[09a-FastMCP-GCP-Plan.md](./09a-FastMCP-GCP-Plan.md):** Checklist/plan corresponding to the FastMCP/GCP example.

These notes aim to provide both conceptual understanding and practical guidance for working with MCP across different implementation approaches.
